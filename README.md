# Text Forge

Text Forge is a lightweight, extensible, and mode-driven text editor. It's customizable, scriptable, and ready to handle
any format and language in a data-driven and object-oriented environment without any change in source.

## ‚ú® Core Principles

- **Language-Agnostic Foundation:**
  
  **No built-in assumptions** about HTML, Python, JSON, or any language. All formatting and highlight rules are defined 
  in editable and portable assets.

- **Hot-Pluggable Modes:**

  Each mode is self-contained with syntax-highlight, formatting behavior, and buffers based on file types.

- **Scriptable Shortcuts & Actions:**

  All actions (even `open` and `new`) and their shortcuts are modular scripts separated from source.

## üß† Project Structure

### Core
Text Forge have an object-oriented core with systems to handle any extension type, so anything can change without change
one line in the core.

### Data-driven UI
Text Forge uses configuration files to load UI and have flexible UI system for have highly extendable UI sections.

### Editor API & Modes
In Text Forge we have a **mode** to work with a file, modes will load by Editor API in app to handle loading/saving, 
syntax-highlighting and auto formatting, so Text Forge can handle any file using modes in `/modes` folder!

### Script & Shortcuts
Need to customize any option functionality? So you can replace your code in its script in `/scripts` folder to create 
your own actions. Need complete UX customization? Create your shortcut mapping in `/shortcuts` folder without touch 
editor core!
