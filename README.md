# Text Forge

Text Forge is a lightweight, extensible, and mode-driven text editor. It offers unlimited language support with all features in a data-driven and object oriented environment.

---

## ‚ú® Core Principles

- Standalone Architecture  
  Not embedded in another environment ‚Äî fully self-contained with its own input handling, UI layers, and mode logic. Just run and use!

- Language-Agnostic Foundation  
  No built-in assumptions about HTML, Python, JSON, or any language. All formatting and highlight rules are defined in editable and portable assets.

- Hot-Pluggable Modes  
  Each mode is self-contained (e.g., modes/html/) with highlight, formatting behavior, and buffers based on file types.

- Scriptable Shortcuts & Actions  
  Bind any user-defined action to keyboard shortcuts. All actions are written in GDScript and loaded dynamically so anyone can customize them without change anything in core.

## üß† Project Structure

### Core
Text Forge have a object oriented core with data-driven UI, so anything can change without change one line in core.

### Data-driven UI
Text Forge uses configuration files to load UI and have flexible UI system.

### Editor API & Modes
In text forge we have a "mode" to work with a file, modes will load by Editor API in app to handle loading/saving, syntax-highlighting and auto formatting, so Text Forge can handle any file using modes in `modes` folder!

### Script & Shortcuts
Need to costumize any option functionality? So you can raplace your code in its script in `scripts` folder to create your own actions. Need complete UX costumization? Create your shortcut mapping in `shortcuts` folder without touch editor core!
