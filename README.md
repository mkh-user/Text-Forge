# Text Forge

Text Forge is a lightweight, extensible, and mode-driven text editor. It's customizable, scriptable, and ready to handle
any format and language in a data-driven and object-oriented environment without any change in source.

## ‚ú® Core Principles

- **Language-Agnostic Foundation:**
  
  **No built-in assumptions** about HTML, Python, JSON, or any language. All formatting and highlight rules are defined 
  in editable and portable assets.

- **Hot-Pluggable Modes:**

  Each mode is self-contained with syntax-highlight, formatting behavior, and buffers based on file types.

- **Scriptable Shortcuts & Actions:**

  All actions (even `open` and `new`) and their shortcuts are modular scripts separated from source.

## Why Text Forge?

Text Forge is a response to the growing demand for tools that **empower** rather than constrain. Designed as a standalone text editor with a focus on **modularity, deep customization, and minimal design**, it offers a flexible and efficient foundation for users who want full control over their editing environment.

With Text Forge:
- The internal architecture is structured to make components easy to add, remove, or redefine
- A versatile formatting engine enables precise handling of complex, structured text
- It delivers a lightweight, independent experience‚Äîusable without dependency on heavy ecosystems
- **It provides a core foundation that can be rapidly adapted to various file types, formatting styles, and workflows**‚Äîin essence, Text Forge is more than an app; it functions as a *framework for building custom editors*

Our goal is to create a tool that puts creative and technical decisions back in the hands of the user‚Äîwhere they belong.

## üß† Project Structure

### Core
Text Forge have an object-oriented core with systems to handle any extension type, so anything can change without change
one line in the core.

### Data-driven UI
Text Forge uses configuration files to load UI and have flexible UI system for have highly extendable UI sections.

### Editor API & Modes
In Text Forge we have a **mode** to work with a file, modes will load by Editor API in app to handle loading/saving, 
syntax-highlighting and auto formatting, so Text Forge can handle any file using modes in `/modes` folder!

### Script & Shortcuts
Need to customize any option functionality? So you can replace your code in its script in `/scripts` folder to create 
your own actions. Need complete UX customization? Create your shortcut mapping in `/shortcuts` folder without touch
